<img src=

<p> Welcome to my all about me page, this is my first webpage I have designed. Do not judge my lack of content this is a 
working in progress. I am a fourth year undergrad student that is majoring in Information Technology and Management. I was 
raised in Oswego and Naperville with my mom and two sisters. One of my favorite things to do is to try new foods, so one 
my pages will be dedicated to all my food adventures I have taken.
