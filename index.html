<h1> Jocelyne Herrera| All About Me </h1>
</header>

 <p> Welcome to my all about me page, this is my first webpage I have designed. Do not judge my lack of content this is a 
working in progress. I am a fourth year undergrad student that is majoring in Information Technology and Management. I was 
raised in Oswego and Naperville with my mom and two sisters. One of my favorite things to do is to try new foods, so one 
   my pages will be dedicated to all my food adventures I have taken. </p>
<p> I have been interning at CMAP for about 7 months and it has helped me further my knowledge of IT world. Before I started my internship 
   I had no clue what the IT industry entailed for me. It has prepared me for the future. I would say it has been a great opportunity to further my
   IT knowledge.</p
